# United States Disease Outbreak Simulation (USDOS) Post-Processing
This project contains R scripts to process data files from USDOS simulations.

## Folder Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:
- `Include_Files`: Contains dependencies necessary to run the `processUSDOS()` function, such as R packages, functions, etc.
- `Source_Files`: Contains R scripts NOT used in the post-processing of USDOS data files.
- `Files_To_Process`: USDOS data files should be put here.
- `FLAPS`: Contains FLAPS files used to determine the number.
- `Maps`: Generated by running `processUSDOS()` and will include maps of simulation output.
- `Data`: Generated by running `processUSDOS()` and includes concatenated long and wide format .csv files used to produce the figures.
- `Figures`: Generated by running `processUSDOS()` and includes concatenated long and wide format .csv files used to produce the figures.

## Files
The following files are included in the project:
- `postProcessing_USDOSv2.1.R`: The main R script for post-processing USDOS runs.
- `run_postProcessing_USDOSv2.1.R`: A shell script for running the post-processing function, processUSDOS().

## Getting Started
To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine. The post-processing scripts require R and several R packages, including `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `reshape2`, `rgdal`, and `ggplot2`. You may need to install these packages before running the scripts.

## Running `processUSDOS()`
To run the post-processing function, `processUSDOS()`, navigate to the `run_postProcessing_USDOSv2.1R` script, set the working directory (line 1), load the `processUSDOS()` function (line 3), and execute the function (lines 5 - 22). Running this script will generate directories labeled `Data`, `Figures`, and `Maps` with desired outputs.

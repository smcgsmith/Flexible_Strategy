# United States Disease Outbreak Simulation (USDOS) Sensitivity Analyses
This project contains R scripts to process data files from USDOS simulations used in sensitivity analyses.

## Folder Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:
- `Dependencies`: Contains dependencies necessary to run the `processUSDOS()` function, such as R packages, functions, etc.
- `Files_To_Process`: USDOS data files should be put here.
- `FLAPS`: Contains FLAPS files used to determine the number.
- `Figures`: Generated by running `processUSDOS()` and includes concatenated long and wide format .csv files used to produce the figures.

## Files
The following files are included in the project:
- `FlexibleControl_SensitivityAnalaysis`: A shell script for running the functions used in sensitivity analyses and generating figures.

## Getting Started
To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine. The post-processing scripts require R and several R packages, including `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `reshape2`, `rgdal`, and `ggplot2`. You may need to install these packages before running the scripts.
